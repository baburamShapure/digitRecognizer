Back on Kaggle after 5 years. Lets start with a simple one. 

Folder arrangement: 

1. adhoc: dirty laundy
2. data: all data files here. 
3. out: all outputs for submissions here. Timestamped. 
4. scripts: all scripts here. 


Musings:

Looked around in the pytorch library. Got a feel for how to specify models and run them. Will be useful when building custom models.  

Also submitted my first prediction file. Fetched a score of about 0.72 on the LB. Interesting! 

Had a recurring issue with tensor types. Finally, a kaggle kernel provided a solution to read the pandas dataframe with the dtype arg set to np.float32. Curious! Never had this problem before.

Pytorch looks interesting. But will fall back to keras.  Been using it for the last 1 and half years. Created 2 new folders inside scripts and models, to keep track of my keras and pytorch models.
